    <h2 class=light> Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hummingbirds are the smallest of birds, </li>
        <li>They are known as Hummingbirds because of the distinctive<br> high frequency sound their wings make as they move.</li>
    </ul>
<br> 
    <h2 id=evo>Evolution</h2>
        <p><strong>BEAK AND FLOWER:</strong> Hummingbirds are <strong>nectarivors</strong>, meaning they get their energy mainly or fully from nectar. They get this nectar exclusively from <strong>ornithophilous</strong>,<em>bird pollinated plants</em>. As plants evolve and change, so does the hmmingbird, specifically the size and shape of its beak. This can also go the other way for some species of hummingbirds, specifically <strong>sicklebills</strong> and <strong>sword-billed</strong>. A small volumeof plants evolved to allow these hummingbird species access to their nectar, as well as to help pollinate the flowers. This co-evolution continues to produce new species of hummingbirds as well as plants</p>

        <p>When talking about plants and their relationship with hummingbirds, we might bring up color. Plants pollinated by hummingbirds typically create flowers in orange, pink, and red shades. This is because these are the color of flowers usually frequented by hummingbirds. Hummingbirds see wavelengths close to near-ultraviolet, although flowers pollinated by birds don’t reflect these wavelength. This is unlike insect pollinated flowers, which reflect wavelengths that in- sects can see. Hense, hummingbird pollinated flowers are basically invisible to insects, leaving them exclusivly to the hummingbirds. </p>

    
<br>
        <p><strong>SEXUAL DIMORPHISM:</strong> Hummingbirds have a unique characteristic when it comes to male and female size difference between different species. When looking at male and female size difference in large-bodied species of hummingbirds, the males are larger. Yet, in smaller bodied hummingbirds, the female will have the greater size. We call this term <STRONG>sexual size dimorphism</STRONG>.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h2 id="cha">Characteristics</h2>
        <p><strong>LIFESPAN</strong>: The first year of a hummingbirds life is arguably the most important. Most hummingbirds die within a year of hatching, when they are at their most vulnerable state. For those who survive the first year and pass the <strong>fledging state</strong>, <em>period from birth till capible of flight</em>, they can live up to 10 years or longer. Most North American species typically have a shorter ifes- pan, that of 3-5 years.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>KIDNEY FUNCTION</strong>: Typical nectar consumption per day usually amounts to 5 times the body weight of the hummingbird. This means that the liver is working hard to process all the water within the nectar. During this time, the liver filters the water <strong>using glomerular filtration rates</strong>, <em>the rate in which filtered water passes through the kidneys</em>. This rate in which water moves through the kidneys helps ensure that the bird does ot beome overly hydrated. However, at night or when not to find water for a brief amount of time, this filteration rate drops to 0. This is to help the hummingbird retain water to keep it hydrated until it can find a water source.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>FLIGHT STABILITY</strong>: The wings of hummingbirds move in an oval shape, compared to the up and down motion of typical birds. When a gust of wind hits the bird from the side, a number of things happen to keep this bird stable. First the bird increases the amplitude of its wing stroke, as well as the angle of its wings. It changes amplitude and stoke asymmetrically from one one wing to the next. Also happening during this time is that the surface area of the tail feathers increases and they take on a fan like appearance. When hovering, hummingbirds use a <strong>visual system</strong> which allows them to distinguish their own movement from that of other sources and possible predators.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>VOCAL LEARNING AND SONG</strong>: Hummingbirds use a variety of sounds, ranging from whistles ans buzzes to chirps and squeaks. A vocal learning trait for these birds comes from 7 unique nuclei that enable it to imitate a sound. This unique trait can be found in 2 other different bird species, that of parrots and songbirds. It is also found in humans, bats, dolphins and whales.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>VISION</strong>: The ability of fast paced visual processing while flying or hovering comes from a large array of <strong>retinal neurons</strong>. These neurons allow for precise <strong>spatial resolution</strong>, <em>the ability for the bird to precisly measure space and dimention</em>. We find in this birds brain an enlargement in the <strong>pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali</strong>. This region of the brain is responsible refining the visual processing of the hummingbird during fast paces flight as well as hovering. It allows the bird enhanced perception while insect hunting and high-speed courtship, as well as helping to out manouver a predator.</p>
<br><br>
    <h2 id="fea">Feather Hue</h2>
        <p>Coloration serves 2 general purposes, that of courtship as well as territorial competetion in males. Males coloration comes from bright plumage that comes from feather <strong>pigmentation</strong>. It also comes from prism like cells within the top layer of the feathers on the wings, breast, back, and head. When these cells get hit by sunlight, the light gets split into <strong>wavelengths</strong> which reflect the colors in varies intensity’s. The feathers use <strong>diffraction grating</strong> <em>which defracts and splits light into multiple beams traveling in all directions</em>. The result is that these color beams create a structural coloration for the bird.
<br><br>
        If a hummingbirs feather colors seem muted, simply moving their feather positions will re- sult in bright vivid colors. An example of feather position can be seen in the species of <strong>Anne’s hummingbirds</strong>. The males position their feathers and bodies towards the direction of the sun, which instantly amplifies color display to a possible female mate. There was study done on Anne’s hummingbirds found a corrilation between color vibrancy and protein. The study found that when given more protein, a bird would produce crown feathers that were more colorful. Also found was that when given higher levels of protein, green tail feathers had a higher hue of yellow.</p>
<br>
    <h2 id="fli">Flight Aerodynamics</h2>
        <p>To study flight, researchers used windtunnels and highspeed video and photo imagery. In a study involving <strong>Anna’s hummingbirds</strong>, the downstroke produces 75% of their weight support, while the upstroke produces the remaining 25%. With each wingstroke, the wings travel in the shape of a “figure 8”. In the past, it was thought that lift was equal in both the upstroke and downstroke cycle similar to insects of the same size. This experiment showed that although somewhat sililar, hummingbird stroke is distinct from that of insects.</p>
<br><br>
    <H2 id="die">Diet</H2>
        <p><strong>TONGUE CHARACTERISTICS</strong>: To drink nectar, hummingbirds are equiped with a long specialized forked tongue which they use to lap this food source. Their tongue contains tubes which run through its entire length, helping the bird suck up the nectar. It was thought that capillary contraction was waht helped draw nectar into the tubes, but high speed photograph show something different. They reveal that as the tongue enteres the nectar, the tubes open up along their sides, then close up trapping the nectar. The nectar is then able to travel up through the tongue into the beak. The tongue remains coiled up inside the beak until read to drink nectar. When ready, it springs forward into the nectar. This fast acton acts as a pump, helping carry the nectar up the tongue when it coils back up.</p>
<br>
        <p><strong>ARTIFICIAL NECTAR SOURCES</strong>: When in the wild, hummingbirds get hteir nectar from flowers, which is a mixture consisting of 55% sucrose, 21%fructose, and 21% glucose. Hummingbirds can also get their energy from nectar feeders taht people put up. While you might enjoy watching the birds feed, there is a downside to this type of feeding. The resulting consequence from nectar feeders is that the birds might not seek s much nectar from flowers, resulting in a loss of <strong>pollination</strong>. There are 2 way of obtaininga nectar feeder, buy one or make it yourself. When buying one, the nectar usually contains preservatives and dyes,which are unnecessary for birds. When making one yoursef, its fairly common to mix the solution 1:4 in sugar to water ratio. However, if you make the sugar content a little higher, the hummingbirds will become more agressive to others trying to get the nectar. Never use “raw” or organic sugar in the mex- ture, as this is harmful to the birds because of iron that these sugars contain. Also never use molasses, artificial sugars or brown sugar as this too can be harmful to the birds. While honey isnt harmful to hummingbirds, it still should be avoided because when it is added to water. <strong>Microorganisms</strong> can easily grow inside the solutuon making it spoil fast.</p>
<br><br>
    <h2 id="rep">Reproduction</h2>
        <p>Currently, research has found that male hummingbirds dont help in the nesting of babies. Most species of these birds make a similar nest to that of other bird species on tree branches or shrubs. Nest sizes are determined by the siz of the individual species creating it, ranging is size from half a walnut to a few inches in diameter. Usually either <strong>spiders silk</strong> or <strong>linchen</strong> <em>a composite organism</em>, are used to bind the nest together. The benefit of using spider silk is that it allows the nest to grow along with the baby birds.
        The female usually lays 2 white eggs, and though they are the smallest eggs for bird species, they are actually big compared to the size of the mother. The <strong>incubation</strong> period takes from 14 to 23 days depending on the species laying the eggs. The baby birds get fed <strong>arthropods</strong> as well as nectar which the mother regurgitates into their mouth.</p>
<br><br>
    <h2 id="ran">Range</h2>
        <p>Hummingbirds are restricted to America, ranging from Alaska to the southern tip of South America as well as the Caribbeans. Most species can be found in tropical locations in south or central America, but a few can be found in temperate climates as well. There are also a few species including the <strong>hillstars</strong> which live in the <strong>Andes mountains</strong> at up to an altitude of 17,100 feet. The largest collection of hummingbird species can be found in the humid tropical forest of the north Andes mountain range. The number of different species that inhabit the <strong>Atlantic Forest</strong> as well as Central America and mexico exceeds numbes found in South Amerca, Caribbeans, the United States, and Canada. To put this in perspective, the United Staes has 25 recorded species, while both Canada and Chile have less than 10. On the otherhand, Colombia has over 160 species, while Ecuador has close to 130.</p>
<br><br>
    <h2 id="mig">Migration</h2>
        <p>Typically North American species migrate south starting around fall to spend their winters in Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbeans. Southern species move up north during winters in the south. Ther are however a few species that stay year round, like the species found in Flordia or those in the southwest deserts. The <strong>Annes hummingbird</strong> is a year round resident of south Arizona and California. There is also the <strong>buff-bellied hummingbird</strong> which spends
        its year round residency in Flordia. The <strong>Rufous hummingbird</strong> is the most northern breeding species, and it often breeds in large numbers in the temperate climates in North America.</p>
